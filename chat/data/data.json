"comments": "This punch bowl's pseudo-armorial was satirically drawn to poke fun at English political figures of the late 1760s for their opposition to John Wilkes (1727-97). A proponent of civil liberties and American independence, Wilkes was elected several times to the House of Commons, but repeatedly expelled for attacking King George III and his loyalists.  Acquired in 1914, this bowl was the first Chinese Export porcelain object to enter the Institute's permanent collection.",

Nevertheless, a technical virtuosity is apparent in the overglaze enamels which create a richly varied design of butterflies and flowers on a green stipple ground. A work such as this, eggshell thin and of flawless brushwork, is the reward of 2,500 years of constant effort by the Chinese to create faultless ceramics. It is natural that such exquisite objects often functioned as purely decorative pieces.",

"comments": "This standing figure is a bodhisattva, a being who has postponed its own passage to nirvana in order to guide others to salvation. Bodhisattvas are often depicted as paired attendants to a buddha. This sculpture, too, was probably once worshipped as part of a triad of sculptures, positioned to either the left or right of a central icon. \r\n\t\r\nThis bodhisattva stands on a stone base (the square plinth, two lions, and the lower half of a lotus-shaped pedestal) that was created for a separate sculpture of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni. Several lengthy inscriptions on the base explain that an original sculpture was created in 570, and then another was installed at the same temple in 581, both utilizing this base. In 574, an emperor of the Northern Zhou dynasty (557–81) prohibited Buddhism in China, and many idols were desecrated. This may be the reason the base has some apparently intentional damage (two of four lions have been removed) and is no longer with its original sculpture. At some later date, the base came to be used for the present bodhisattva. In the early 1900s, it became the first work of Asian art to enter Mia’s collection.",

The inscription of this work, however, indicates that it was commissioned by a Japanese patron in the early 20th century and, its artistic balance between formalistic and realistic concerns creates a heightened aesthetic tension remarkably different from the earlier prototypes.\r\nThe inscription reads:\r\n\r\nIn this world both style and taste are subjective, so don't hesitate to call this work sweet or sour. During the thirty-first year of the Kuang-hsu reign (1905) on an auspicious day when the full moon was gloriously yellow I painted this . . .in old Beiping at the refined request of Master Sato.\r\n\r\nBai Haonian, from Changli district in the Qing Kingdom",

It is assumed that these tables were originally made in pairs to be placed together to make a circular table or separated and placed against a wall.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth-century carpenter's manual, Lu-pan Ching, clearly sets out the construction criteria for such tables including the half-width back legs seen here that would form a whole when placed together with their mate. The solid construction of this table with its generous use of timber, supporting cross-stretchers, thick cusped aprons, and archaic style feet (called \"double-hoof\" feet) suggest that it is one of the earlier examples of half-round tables to survive.",

This scroll features the rectilinear and multi-faceted cliffs and elongated spreading pines characteristic of the famous Huangshan mountains of Anhui province. The linear, rather spare style capturing the fissured forms and surfaces of the rocks and trees, owes a great deal to Hongren as well as to the solitary nature of Zhu's own personality. Zhu is also said to have studied and copied works by various Yuan dynasty masters: their influence is observed in the extreme degree of simplification in his sparse landscape paintings.\r\n\r\nThe inscription reads:\r\n\r\nDuring the first lunar month of the year 1668, painted at leisure in the Bamboo Hill Inn on the River Gau by Zhu Chang, called Shanshi.",

Simple large images of fruit and vegetables fill the pages of this album. The point of these still lifes is hardly the importance of the subject matter—mushroom, turnips, or peapods—but rather the complex formal arrangement of pictorial elements and the rich and subtle techniques with which they are given form. In adopting this approach,Bian creates images quite distinct from earlier masters with a dry ink technique that resembles nothing so much as charcoal drawings.\r\nThe subjects inlcude cabbage, a pun for wealth; mushrooms, representing good health; turnips; eggplants; bamboo shoots, a pun for grandsons; peapods, lotus rhizome and water caltrap, emblems of benevolence and cleverness; and arrowroot bulbs representing happy tidings for parents and compassion.",

Wenchang is represented as a handsome man in the sitting posture. Sometimes he is also shown standing upon a fish, because the carp of the Yellow River is believed to make an ascent of the stream in the spring of each year, and those who succeed in passing the rapids of Longmen in Henan, become changed into dragons. This supposed transformation of fish to dragon has become an example and synonym for the literary success of the industrious student.\r\nThe relatively large size and unusual palette of green, blue, and aubergine enamels distinguish this Cizhou ceramic.

It reads in part:\r\n\r\nSurrounded by ten-thousand li of water is\r\nwhite cloud village, amidst the flowers is\r\nbuilt a grass hut;\r\nEvening lotus are reflected in clear pools,\r\ngood friends face one another on verandas…\r\nThe river-side mountains are green without end,\r\nand often seem to float in an endless expanse.\r\n\r\nOn a summer day in the year 1614, I entrusted (my ideas) to the brush at the Northern Suburb Mountain Cottage.

Most Chinese velvet carpets are decorated with floral décor and it is unusual to find a velvet carpet featuring official dragon imagery. The large scale, imperial five-claw dragons and yellow ground of this carpet indicate it was used in a formal palace setting, possibly an audience hall or throne room.\r\nAs with official court costumes, the Imperial Household Agency was responsible for ordering palace furnishings and regulating their correct use within the public rooms and royal residences. The main centers for the production of luxury silk carpets were in South China (where the best silk was produced) in cities like Nanking, Chang-Chou and Hang-chou.",

Characterizing a majority of his landscapes are an elegant, quiet mood, and clear, understated brushwork that stands between the refinement of Wen Zhengming (1470-1559) and the simpler style of Shen Zhou (1427-1509), the two leading masters of the Wu school.\r\nBorn in Suzhou, Qian was orphaned at an early age and had little formal education until he became a pupil of the great literatus, Wen Zhengming. He evolved into an avid book collector and gained a reputation as a fine poet. While Qian often painted in Wen's style, his personal approach is recorded as having been derived more from that of Wen's teacher and friend Shen Zhou, the legendary founder of the Wu school.\r\nShen's style, defined by simple blunt brushwork, clear compositions, and transparent mineral colors is clearly evident in these landscapes by Qian. The remaining four leaves of this album are in a private Chinese collection.",

The type was produced at several kilns in a variety of glazes.\r\nThe subtle color of this brown glazed ware, called kaki(persimmon) by the Japanese, was derived by a very high content of iron which forms a brown skin on the surface that contrasts with a darker color beneath the surface. The fact that the bowl is glazed down to the base, with the foot and interior also glazed indicates the earlier phase of this ware's manufacture during the Northern Song period (960-1127). The fine hard clay of the body suggests the Yaozhou kiln in Shanxi province as the likely source of manufacture.",

The jar is wheel-turned with a carefully trimmed foot, shoulder, and lip.

Though called libation cups, these vessels would have been primarily used for display, and they would have been accompanied by beautifully crafted hardwood stands. The simple organic shapes favored by the Ming dynasty gave way to increasingly elaborate and detailed forms during the Qing dynasty.

A chief glory of far eastern ceramics, celadon was eventually produced in Korea, Japan, Thailand and exported from China to India, Persia, Turkey, Egypt and Southeast Asia. Accordingly, a characteristic of many post-Sung Lung-ch'uan celadons is that they are large, heavily potted bowls and dishes such as this one, which could withstand the rigors of transit over great distances.

"description": "Mortuary figures, pair of, representing warriors both wear armor, with curious head-dresses, and one carries a sword-like object. Four of these figures were found at the entrance of a tomb in Honan province. Two bought by M.I.A., and two by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. They are fashioned of polychromed pottery of the greyish cast associated with Wei. Traces of faded terra cotta color remain. These are unusually large tomb figures.",
"comments": "These guardian figures exhibit the classic elements of the mature Northern Wei style (386-584) including a rigid frontal pose, elongated torso and emphasis on lineal drapery patterns. The facial features are less stylized, however. With active and intent expressions, the heads turn, in contrast to the stiff flat bodies. These figures were unearthed along with two others at the entrance of a Northern Wei tomb in Southern Henan province. The four figures were likely placed against a wall where they functioned as guardians at the tomb door.",

These visual symbols are the basis for the sixty-four hexagrams of the ancient divination text, the I-Qing or The Book of Changes which was formulated during Western Zhou (1050-772 BCE). In addition to divination, the eight trigrams played a vital role in Daoist alchemical practices and helped explain the cosmological principles of transformation.

"comments": "This large, ornate vase is shaped to vaguely imitate an ancient bronze wine vessel. Eight ears project from the neck and shoulder of the vase: four at the neck are carved in the form of a bird, while those at the shoulder are in the form of an animal mask with loose pendant rings. The main area of decoration is carved with animal masks like those commonly found on ancient bronze vessels. Its tall lid is adorned with a band of phoenix designs and a stylized lotus-flower finial. \r\nThe vessel, carved in an imperial workshop, reflects the interest in archaic Chinese culture that flourished during the Emperor Qianlong’s reign (1736–95). When translated into jade, however, the powerful archaic motifs that once echoed ancient rites lost their original meanings and symbolic value, ultimately serving only as ornamental elements.",

He wanted the bao (“to treasure”) character – the lower left of the four characters in the inscription - to pictorially combine several other characters appropriate for the auspicious occasion, including “emperor” and “80”. The upward-facing arc at the bottom of the character indicates an old form of Chinese gold currency, implying wealth. The ornaments on the bowls depict stylized scrolling lotus flowers, branches, and leaves. These were extremely auspicious motifs, implying the continuation of the imperial lineage.",

The attributes depicted here include (1) a fan, symbol of Zhong Lichuan, patron saint of the military; (2) an iron crutch and double gourd, symbol of Li Tieguai, protector of the weak and ill; (3) a bamboo tube containing rods, symbol of Zhang Guolao, patrol saint of calligraphers and painters; (4) a flute, emblematic of Han Xiangzi, patron saint of musicians; and (5) a flower basket, symbol of Lan Caihe, patron of florists and gardeners. Superbly worked in cast, chased, and filigree techniques, these objects reflect the virtuosity commonly associated with Qian Long period (1736-1795) decorative arts.

This thanka with its Chinese mounting is from a set of woven copies modeled after an earlier Tibetan painting.\r\nThe Lamaist monk Mkhas-grub Rje (The Abbot Ka Drub) is shown here holding an offering to a vision of his teacher Tsong-Kha-pa the great reformer and founder of the Dge-lugs-pa school of Tibetan Buddhism. Tsong-Kha-pa is shown seated on an elephant mount in the upper left hand corner. Two monks assist Ka Drub, one in service at the altar, the other reciting scripture in the lower right. In the upper right corner is the conqueror of death (Yamantaka) and in the lower left the fierce protector of the Buddhist religion (Mahakala) all within a landscape setting.",

"comments": "Plum blossoms were a favorite motif of flower painters during the Ming period. The plum tree is long-lived—specimens up to a thousand years old are said to be found in many places in China. Their crooked and gnarled branches, young green shoots, and flowers are much admired. The physical toughness of such rugged old plum trees, blooming in wintry desolation, symbolizes the ideal secluded scholar, whose moral toughness makes him resilient. The inscription records the occasion of this careful rendering: \r\n\r\nI have recently received gifts of a poem from my distinguished relative Shizhai, chief advisor to the Prime Minister, and I greatly appreciate his kindness. Using the same rhyme, I have taken the occasion to combine a poem with flowers in ink as an expression of our sincere friendship.\r\n\r\nThere never was found such a flower in the Northland\r\nThe wave of a brush, a slanting branch expresses an image of thought.\r\nPure, clean, exalted and natural, it surpasses all common plants\r\nOne fitting to present the family of a retired statesman of the imperial court.\r\n\r\nThe first day of winter (November 7) in the fifth year of Jingtai, being the cyclical year of jiaxu (1454). Greetings from your humble relative Wang Qian.",

Literati artists held a special fondness for bamboo; its energetic growth, ability to remain green through the cold season and ability to bend without breaking were qualities associated with the character of the gentleman scholar. We know from Shao's freely executed inscription that the artist's chief motive was expressionistic rather than representational.\r\n\r\nThe brush must be free and unhindered\r\nIn order to achieve its greatest potential\r\nThat accomplishment can only be attained\r\nOutside of the inkwell (in the mind of the artist).\r\n\r\nYour friend Mi, recorded in the sixth month of the Chih-shih cycle (1629)",

"description": "Sarcophagus, with accompanying memorial tablet and cover, made for the Chinese General, Prince Cheng Ching, 524 A.D. The six bas-reliefs comprising this group include the two ends and two sides of the sarcophagus, the tablet, and its cover. The sides are decorated in low relief with five groups of historical personages, illustrating filial piety scenes, in a landscape of trees and mountains in which dragons, phoenix, and other symbolical animals roam. The head end bears a scene including a bridge leading over a lotus pond to a gate decorated with 24 bells representing 12 pairs of musical accords. Two guardians flank the gate. The foot end carries a large dragon in a landscape. The memorial tablet bears a long inscription including Cheng Ching's biography, the Emperor's eulogy, and the date 524 A.D. The sides are decorated with large dragons. The cover of the tablet is surrounded by a bevelled edge of conventionalized dragon heads and contains remnants of bronze handles at the four corners. Along the sides, on the top surface, are eight blank squares indicating places for sacrificial vessels. The major figures and forms on the stones stand in relief and have been polished to form an even surface; the spaces betwen were left rough. All six reliefs are in fairly good condition with the exception of the cover for the memorial tablet which has been gouged at the corners. The sarcophagus was undoubtedly carved at Loyang, the Northern Wei capitol from 484 A.D.",
"comments": "This sarcophagus, as well as the epitaph cover and the accompanying tablet, were reportedly recovered from a tomb located in Lijia’ao village, northwest of Luoyang in Henan province. Together they document an important stage in the development of the pictorial tradition in Chinese art. Buddhist, Confucian, and Daoist imagery intermingle within a landscape setting that anticipates the later genre of landscape painting in Chinese art. Along each side of the sarcophagus, amid trees and mountains, five scenes illustrate the Confucian virtue of filial piety, or respect for one’s parents, elders, and ancestors. Daoist and Buddhist imagery is prominent in the heavenly scene above: immortals riding on dragons, phoenixes, and birds. \r\n\r\nDuring the early sixth century in northern China, it was common to place stone memorial tablets in the tombs of the nobility. The memorial tablet bears an inscription dated to 524 and includes a biography and a eulogy to Yuan Mi (d. 523), whose sarcophagus this is. Yuan Mi was the grandson of Emperor Xianwen (r. 466–70) of the Northern Wei dynasty and served as governor of Qizhou. He received the posthumous title King of Zhenjin (Chaste and Lofty).",

The drip-glaze decoration was applied by a traditional Tang technique called sancai (three color).

It differs from earlier yue ware examples in that the spout is not set on the shoulder of the vessel but rather at the top of a simple, elegantly shaped container nearly devoid of decoration. It is possible that silver or even glass vessels imported from the Middle East during Tang (618-906) may have influenced the basic shape and placement of the bird head at the top of the vessel. The refined form and pure white color however is reflective of Chinese taste in early porcelain.",

The faces are highly individualized, indicating through their large mouths, eyes and beard, that they are of Khotanese, rather than Chinese origin. Painted figures such as these are the predecessors to the impressive glazed tomb figurines that later distinguished Tang ceramics.",

They are also accompanied by flying celestials (apsara) in a paradise-like setting based on Esoteric Buddhist teachings. The seated bodhisattva here, originally the leftmost of the three primary figures, is backed by a halo and wears elaborate robes and jewelry. In his large crown is a small depiction of a buddha, the superior being from which the bodhisattva emanated.",

"description": "The shape of this vessel, called a Kien in its inscription, is very like that of the earlier Kuei. Fundamentally a Kien was a basin for holding water, but it is more probable that this example was not a profane vessel, but a ritual one. A companion vessel, exactly like this one and with the same inscription, is in the Freer Gallery. The decor is desposed in three belts separated by bands of plait-pattern, each strand in the plait made up of a number of very thin threads. A similar plait appears on the foot rim. The neck rim is adorned with a narrow band of cowries. The top and bottom belts on the body carry interlaced dragons, the head of every second one being close to the lower margin, the intervening heads being close to the upper. In the broad central belt are t'ao-t'ieh heads, every second seen right as the vessel stands, the intervening ones seen from above. This intricate scheme of interlaced bodies is clearly to be seen in Karlgren, number 51, figures 53 and 54. The four stout handles have t'ao-t'ieh heads at the top. This creature, with broad rolled up nose and a protruding, hooked crest in place of the ancient forehead sheild, is very different from the early ogre head. A row of stylized cicadas adorns the front and sides of the handles, and there are interlaced dragons on the flat, movable rings suspended from two of the handles. The technical execution of these decor elements narrow bare borders to every band, the center filled with either spirals or volutes with triangles, is exceedingly close to that on vessels of the Li-yu find (Umehara, Etude, plates 1 ff.) This is particularly interesting since Li-yu is in northern Shansi and the present vessels, according to Jung Keng (Shang-Chou, Volume 1, Page 470), were found in Huei-hien in northern Honan, thus both belong to the northern sphere. C.F. Yau suggests Kin-ts'un as the locale of this basin. Patina Light green with patches of blue. The inscription reads 'Kien-vessel [to be] handled [i.e. used] by the nobleman Chi.'

The interlocked serpentine relief appears in three bands encircling the neck and the main body, separated by a frieze of braided ropes. Intertwined dragons wriggle within these bands, their bodies embellished with incised spirals and meanders. The vessel bears an inscription on the interior wall, which reads: The jian for amusement of the son of Lord Zhi.\r\nZhi was a ruling family of the Jin state, and Zhi Yao, the last member of its linage, was killed in 453 BCE. The decorative style, together with the inscription, identify the vessel as cast at the foundry of the Jin state.",

"description": "This vessel is a remarkable example of its type, and of perfect workmanship. The body is divided into three horizontal belts by narrow, bare interstices uninterrupted by the scored flanges which, with the handle of the vessel, delimit four panels. The plain handle has an animal's head with zigzag lines across the nose and C-shaped horns with parallel lines in thin, thread relief. The lid is partly shaped as a plastic animal. The head, with the forehead lozenge and bottle horns of a t'ao-t'ieh, has other, more realistic details well-modelled ears and a mouth with saw-like teeth. The body is that of a long-drawn-out dragon in low relief reclining along the center of the lid. The central flange, curving with the body in the looped tail, has straight and T-shaped scores. A t'ao-t'ieh and various types of dragons figure in a decor scheme that covers almost the entire body of the vessel. The bodied t'ao-t'ieh with S-shaped horns in the middle belt is flanked by strongly stylized head turning dragons. Also strongly stylized are the dragons in the foot belt, which are similar to those on vessels 50.46.43, Karlgren #11, and 50.46.89, Karlgren #21. The consecutive dragons in the neck belt are not identical. To the right is an ordinary beaked dragon with recumbent C-shaped horn and a small vertical crest. The dragon under the spout of the vessel has no crest. Its horn is heart-shaped, and it has the drawn-out, pointed eye of the t'ao-t'ieh below. Its enormous beak is drawn out to parallel the curve in the rim. Inside the curve of the beak is a small, head turning dragon. The big dragon on the lid has spirals at the base of the horns and a single scale between parallel zigzag lines that flank the central flange, forming the common lozenge pattern. The legs, in flat relief, flank the big dragon, thier tails meeting at the end of the lid. Patina light blue-green.",
"comments": "The gong is a type of ritual vessel used to serve wine. It was produced primarily during the reigns of King Wu and King Zhao in the late Shang (c. 1300–1046 BCE) and early Western Zhou (c. 1046–977 BCE,) dynasties. Found in Anyang, this deep boat-shaped pouring vessel displays almost perfect workmanship. Taotie (composite animal) masks are found on the handle and the lower registers of the sides. Three dragons decorate the surface of the vessel. The consecutive dragons in the neck belt are not identical. On the upper register to the right is a beaked dragon with recumbent C-shaped horn. The dragon under the spout of the vessel has a heart-shaped horn. Its enormous beak parallels the curve in the rim. The lid is fashioned as a beast with bottle-shaped horns and fierce mouth. Its long, dragon-like body extends down the lid and loops at the end. All these features resemble those seen on a pair of gong excavated from the tomb of Fuhao, consort of King Wuding (r. c. 1250–1192 BCE), thus identifying Mia’s example to be one of the earliest known gong.",

"comments": "As with many other types of bronze vessels, the ding had a pottery prototype dating back as early as the Peiligang culture of the Neolithic period (c. 7000–5000 BCE). Bronze versions of the flat-legged ding began to be cast early in the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1300 BCE). The flat legs of those Shang ding were mostly shaped like stylized dragons. In the early Western Zhou period (c. 1046–977 BCE), it became popular for the ding legs to take the form of birds. In this example, the shallow bowl with a round bottom is supported by three flattened legs, each rendered in the form of a bird standing upon its claws and tail. Above the legs is a row of cicadas. Perhaps because the life cycle of the cicada was seen as symbolic of renewed life—they lie dormant underground for seven to 14 years, and emerge for only one summer—the insect was a popular motif during the Shang and Zhou dynasties, commonly represented in bronze and jades.",

"description": "He, inscribed. Vessels of the He class vary according to the shape of the belly, which may be that of a Li, a Li-ting, or a Ting. This unique specimen has the hemispherical shape of a Ting. The handle, surmounted by an animal's head; the chain and its rings; the small handle on the lid decorated with dragon heads; the spout and the legs are very simple. The blade decor of the spout and legs, and the dragon motif in the neck and lid belts -- so dissolved as to leave only the eyes and interlocked double spirals as remnants of the bodies -- are in no way uncommon. In view of their off-hand treatment, the decor of the belly is doubly striking. It consists of rows of scales in flat,double-band relief, each scale being filled with a dissolved cicada motif in thread relief. This scale decor is a harbinger of the scale-band of the Middle Chou style. Therefore this vessel, with its cylindrical legs of the earlier periods, is best dated in the latter part of the early Chou, on the border of Middle Chou, i.e., circa B.C.900. Patina gray and blue-green",
"comments": "The he wine container is an old vessel type that emerged as early as the Erlitou period, dating from the 17th century BCE. During the late Shang dynasty (c. 1300–1046 BCE), its shape evolved—its bulging body, with narrow neck and spout, was supported by three cylindrical legs, as seen in this example. The vessel bears an inscription identifying that it was cast by “Shi” in honor of his father, “Gui.” Recent archaeological activities have established that all bronzes bearing the “Shi” inscription were cast during the late Shang and early Western Zhou periods. The vessel’s main body bears a decorative motif consisting of rows of scales in flat, double-band relief. It is generally recognized that by the mid–Western Zhou period (c. 976–886 BCE) Chinese bronze art began a process of stylistic transformation from that of the waning Shang to that of the distinct Western Zhou. Such change is marked by the replacement of taotie masks with patterned decoration. This vessel, however, demonstrates that in the early Western Zhou, the new decorative trend had already emerged.",

"comments": "Jia were among the earliest Chinese bronze vessels cast during the Erlitou period (c. 2000–1600 BCE). Archaeological excavations have found more jia and jue (another type of wine cup) than ding cauldrons, which held food. This suggests that people of the Erlitou period emphasized the role of wine in ritual ceremonies. Jia became prevalent during the Shang and early Western Zhou dynasties (c. 1600–977 BCE) and gradually fell out of favor and then disappeared during the late Western Zhou (c. 885–771 BCE). It was fashionable in the late Shang to make square variations on originally round types of vessels—hence, a new type of jia emerged. Known as fangjia, or “squared jia,” it had a quadrangular shape and a rectangular or square cross section. In this example, taotie, composite-animal masks, appear on the largest panel on each side, which also features stylized animals, as is typical of much Shang art.",

"description": "The decor of this bell, in cross section a pointed oval with an arched line at the bottom, is quite complicated. The shaft has three decor belts and one bulky ring with a vertically placed suspending device formed by a contorted tiger. The beast stands with body half raised against the shaft, its claws pressing against the lower of the three decor belts. The upper body and neck turn backward, with the tiger biting its own tail. The loop thus completed serves for the suspension of the bell by a strap passed through the loop. Of the three decor belts on the shaft, the upper displays a t'ao-t'ieh (to be seen from above). The two lower belts have dragons that turn alternately upward and downward. The bulbous ring supporting the tiger is decorated with a loosely twined cord pattern and interlaced lines. The top of the bell has rolled up dragons, their bodies formed of bands filled with voluted and triangles. In the two belts between the spikes on the outer surface of the bell are dragons placed alternately upward and downward. The decor field of the lower part of the bell is a magnificant specimen of gaudy Huai decor in which a t'ao-t'ieh bites on the body of a bird-dragon with a big, hooked beak, an S-shaped crest, and a heart-shaped horn. This involved and elaborate decor is carried out with the brilliance and dazzeling skill of the Huai-style bronze art. Patina green and blue-green.",
"comments": "When this bell was made, around 500 BCE, Chinese bells had already evolved over 800 years. They were sophisticated musical instruments. This bell is called a yong, the quintessential bell type found in high-ranking late Zhou tombs. Unlike the bo type, seen elsewhere in this exhibition, it has an arch-shaped bottom, straight sides, cylindrical bosses, and a columnar shank (yong) with a loop suspension device that causes the bell to tilt toward the player rather than remain straight up and down. This permitted greater accuracy in striking than with vertically suspended bells—an important feature, since yong bells can emit two notes depending on whether they are struck in the center or midway to the side. The symmetrical group of bosses on each bell probably served to diminish the nonharmonic overtones emitted by the upper part of the bell, thereby emphasizing the fundamental notes.",

The decor of the several belts is largely based on single and double volutes and volutes with triangles. These typical elements of the Huai decor must, to a degree, be extremely corrupted and geometricized derivatives of zoomorphic motifs (dragons and birds).

"comments": "This wine vessel is one of the most splendid examples of Eastern Zhou bronze art and technique. It is decorated with a geometric, brocade-like pattern of gold, silver, and copper inlay—actually, extremely stylized depictions of dragons and birds. As religious beliefs changed, ritual bronzes became more secular in use and decoration during the Eastern Zhou period. The fearsome taotie (composite animal) masks and symbolic animal motifs of the Shang and Western Zhou periods were increasingly replaced with abstract surface ornament such as “hook and comma” patterns, granulation or, as in this case, metallic inlay. It was done as much to delight the eye as to inspire religious reverence. The vessel is reportedly from Jincun near present-day Luoyang, Henan province, and is part of a magnificent group of burial objects from the royal lineage of the Eastern Zhou.",

"description": "This small sculpture of a kneeling man holding a tube-like vessel in his extended hands is one of a group of similar figures that may have served as torch bearers in a tomb. The sensitively modelled face, with an expression at once tentative and hopeful lends credibility to this supposition. The figure is clothed in a close-fitting garment that wraps from left to right in a broad overlap and is belted with a narrow band. The head-covering, rather like an open helmet, is broad at the back and rises to a peak-like top before descending in a narrow, tounge-shaped band to the forehead. It is bound to the head by a strap that goes down in front of the ears and under the chin. A second strap passes around the head from the forehead to the occiput. This figure is one of a group of bronze sculptures found in the Han family tombs a Kin-ts'un near Lo-yang and reported by W. C. White in Tombs of Old Lo-Yang. The artistic tradition of the early Yin culture, modified by an approach to nature, still persists in some of these small bronze sculptures from the old Lo-yang area. Their general characteristics - the unvarying block-like form, the broad type with large round eyes, the details of costume, particularly the head gear, reflect a new interest in and a closer observation of nature. Such figures constitute the links between early Yin sculptures and those of Han time. Essential characteristics of the earlier works do persist, but in a modified form. One discerns also in these small works, as in some other early Chinese bronzes, a resemblance to certain examples of pre-Columbian art -- a kind of parallelism which points to a similar artistic disposition or a common origin, rather than to any direct influence or intercommunication between these centers of art so widely separated in time and space. However this paralleleism came about, it is clear that the sculptural products of Yin-Chou art reflect traditions of style no longer to be found in those of Han time. Patina green",

"description": "This bell, in cross section a pointed oval with an arched line at the bottom has a bottle-shaped handle that is most unusual. The decor field, confined to the body of the bell, is filled with granulation. It displays a variation of the 'volute with angle' theme; every two such figures combine into larger compounds, the whole resulting in a lozenge pattern. The border is partly a running spiral pattern and partly dissolved dragon figures. At the lower corners are sinuously drawn birds with S- or heart shaped horns. The mask of a playful t'ao-t'ieh must be seen from above. Patina brownish green with brighter green patches.",
"comments": "Although it has the general shape of a small yong bell, this instrument lacks the ring suspension device of the yong as well as the 36 bosses found on most late Zhou bells. And if it were suspended, the composite-animal taotie mask on the body would be upside down. Known as zheng, this type of bell was not used in graduated sets but rather individually, and was held in an upright position. The incised bird and volute, triangular, and running spiral patterns are similar to those found on painted lacquers of the same era, and were prevalent in southern China during the Spring and Autumn (c. 770–476 BCE) and Warring States (c. 475–221 BCE) periods.",

"comments": "Zun is a type of bronze wine vessel used by Shang-dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE) aristocrats during ritual ceremonies to honor their ancestors. This owl-shaped zun is divided into two sections: the removable owl’s-head lid and the bird’s hollow body. Vessels shaped like animals constitute virtually the only bronze sculpture known from the Shang period. Besides this owl, vessels in the form of buffalo, boars, rhinoceroses, elephants, and rams have also survived. This owl is one of the oldest and most naturalistic of the few remaining owl-shaped zun. Its form exhibits the influence of the Shang capital, Anyang, in the North, but the style and casting technique of the vessel (the indentation on the interior walls corresponds to a relief found on the exterior) indicate that it is related to the bronze tradition of the middle Yangzi region in southern China.",

"description": "This unique vessel displays a technical perfection which proves that the artisans of Early Zhou sometimes fully equaled their Yin predecessors in taste and skill. The usual division into four panels is suggested exclusively by the free animals' heads alternating, in the neck region, with the handles. The decor ground, of rounded and acute angled spirals, carries an eyed band with diagonals in the foot belt and antithetical tail-raising birds in flat relief on the belly. The crests of these extraordinary birds split up in three strands, the middle one a short, spearlike point; the other two forming long plumes, one falling staight down past the turned head and in front of the breast, the other going forward past (and parallel with) the beak, then rising in a bold sweep above the head and descending in two parts behind the first strand. Thus three parallel bands descend, the outer two adorned with rounded figures reminiscent of those of a peacock. For comment of these figures see Karlgren, number 29, 50.46.120. From the raised tail three bands descend in a fashion exactly similar to those of the crest. The animal's head on the handle has large tusks protruding at the sides. The hook on the bottom is reminiscent of the bird representation often seen on Kuei handles. patina pale green with patches of blue green. The meaning of the inscription is ' The King attacked Tsi-yu and went out and attacked Naohei. When he came [back], he made liao-sacrifice [burnt-offering] in Tsung Chou and presented to [me], Kuo Po X, cowries, ten double strings. [I] presume in response to extol the king's grace, and so I have made my accomplished dead father's precious Kuei vessel. May for a myriad years sons and grandsons forever treasure and use it.' For comment on the inscription, see Karlgren, number 36 (50.46.119). The birds on the Kuei have a clase parallel on a 'YU' in the Simitomo Collection (Senoku, Volume 2, Plate 67) and on a 'TSUN' in the Imperial Collection, but are, for the rest, unique.

"comments": "Toward the mid–Western Zhou, two of the most noticeable changes that occurred in bronze casting involved the abandonment of the taotie (composite animal) mask motif and the adoption of long inscriptions. This gui displays elaborate birds, a popular motif, on its main decorative register. The birds’ flamboyant design, with their crests and peacock-like plumage, is unique. The lengthy inscription, neatly cast into the cauldron’s bottom, reads as follows: \r\n\r\nZhou King went out to attack Laiyu, then Naohei. Upon his return after victory, he held a liao sacrifice [burnt offering] at the capital Zongzhou [at present-day Xi’an]. He presented to me, X, Duke of Yong, ten strings of cowries [one hundred pieces]. In response, to extol the king’s grace, I have made this precious gui, dedicating it to ancestors.

The neck belt, correspondingly divided by two free animals' heads, carries S-shaped, turning dragons with bug C-shaped crests. The division of the body into panels is achieved entirely by the decor, executed in low, flat relief on a ground of spirals. It consists of pairs of antithetical, tail-raising birds, their crests cleft in three strands. One slants gracefully backward; the second rises over the head in a bold bow and drops to the feet of the bird; the third curves down over the bird's back. From the raised tail a big plume descends to the feet in a C-shape. Tufts appear in the middle of the big crest, and on the descending tail. the effect of this antithetical arrangement of crests and tail plumes is that of rudimentary t'ao-t'ieh masks the nose at the bottom, the hooked forehead shield, and the big horns in reclining C-shape. On the neck of the bird is a scale of the type often found on snakes and owls, and perhaps of some magical significance. Antithetical birds reappear in the rising blades on the neck of the vessel. Here, however, the club-like crest leans forward and a detached horn rises to the top of the blade. Patina blue-green. The inscription reads 'The Prince has made the precious vessel; may sons and grandsons forever use it.'",
"comments": "This vessel form, known as zun, was used to hold wine. Such vessels appeared during the Erligang period of the Shang dynasty (c. 1500–1300 BCE) and reached the height of their popularity in the Western Zhou dynasty (c. 1046–771 BCE). The piece is an example of the earliest of several varieties of zun. By the mid–Western Zhou period (c. 976–886 BCE), bronze decoration began a process of stylistic transformation that can be seen in this piece. The focus is on a pair of large plumed birds, a favored image in the Western Zhou period.",

"comments": "Stylized animal motifs predominate Shang bronze decoration. The dragon, snake, cicada, ram, owl, tiger, and even elephant all make appearances. Yet these creatures were almost always less important than the taotie (composite animal) mask, which typically dominates the largest or most important register of nearly all Shang bronzes. This exquisite food bowl, an early form of the gui with looped handles that became prevalent particularly in the Western Zhou dynasty, has three such masks clearly cast in high relief encircling its cauldron. Below each mask, in the foot band, are two opposing dragons shown in profile, while four similar dragons appear above each mask in the top decorative band. The exact meaning of the taotie mask is unknown. A nine-character inscription cast on the interior bottom may stand for branches of a big clan.",

"description": "The division into four panels is achieved by the hancles only in two places and in the remaining two places by small flanges in the foot belt, a slight ridge in the central belt, and free animals' heads in the neck belt. The flange forms the center of a rudimentary t'ao-t'ieh mask, the ridge the center of a well-contained bodied t'ao-t'ieh with the usual elements. This creature, done with a light touch, is surely one of the most urbane of its kind in the long history of Chinese bronzes. The winged dragons in the foot belt and the birds in the neck belt are, like the t'ao-t'ieh, in thr rounded relief on a bare ground. The handle, with a ramlike animal's head at the top, is adorned with birds' wings in flat band relief on the bow, thus giving the ram's head a bird's body. The bird's long tail descends vertically in the same relief, the end turned up. The bird's leg and foot come down in front, almost to the point of resting on the curled-up tail. This arangement, seen in plastic form on the Ting with supporting animals, Karlgren number 4 (50.46.105), survives in other Kuei vessels in the form of a C-shaped hook below the bow handle. Patina pale green.",
"comments": "The gui was the primary food vessel used in ceremonial rituals for offerings of grain. One of the most important components of the ritual paraphernalia, it was often coupled with the ding (another food vessel). The form was produced as early as the Anyang period of the Shang dynasty (c. 1300–1046 BCE) and developed into many varieties. This vessel, with its wide mouth, ample, bowl-shaped body, and C-shaped handles represents the typical gui of the Western Zhou. The flange forms the center of a taotie animal mask. The handles are topped by horned animal heads, and bird wings are carved in flat-band relief on the bow, thus giving the animal head a bird’s body.",

It was among the first cast vessels, and the earliest example was unearthed from the Erlitou culture (c. 2000–1600 BCE) site. Ding were used to cook meat during a ceremony devoted to ancestral spirits. The vertical handles allowed the vessel to be placed over a fire. There were many variations of the ding. This example with squared body is known as fang-ding, or squared ding. The dominant taotie animal-mask motif appears on each face of the vessel, divided by flanges on four corners.",

"comments": "These bronze bird finials crowned the ends of chariot poles. The stylized animals, with their decorative flanges and C–shaped horns, are in keeping with the aesthetics of ritual vessels of the Shang dynasty, the era preceding the Western Zhou dynasty (c. 1046–c. 771 BCE).\r\n\r\nOne of the birds was cast with a pellet inside its body cavity, which creates a rattling sound when moved. What certain animals meant to the ancient Chinese remains speculative, but they all seem to have held protective and auspicious powers.",

Below is a beast mask dominated by two large almond-shaped eyes with pupils, a broad nose, and a mouth. This ornamentation is typical of divine figures on jades from the Neolithic Liangzhu culture, which flourished in the present-day lower Yangzi River delta. The design on this jade is a simpler form with neither bodies of humans nor beasts. Two pairs of holes along the edge of the plain back allowed it to be attached to other objects. Several semicircular ornaments with similar designs unearthed from Fanshan, the Neolithic site in Zhejiang, were found located near the deceased’s head, an indication that they might have served as hair ornaments.",

On the other side a ram's head, with horns turned down, bites on a head resembling a t'ao-t'ieh but with a raised elephant's trunk instead of the usual ridge in the central line. This remarkable and unusual piece is a powerful example of early Chinese sculpture. Patina green.",
"comments": "A combination of four masks appears on this bronze finial, which originally adorned the end of a pole. A forceful taotie (composite animal) mask with downward-facing C-shaped horns appears on one side of the top. This monster’s face forms a mask on a human head; it has the broad nose typical of early masks. On the other side, a ram’s head, with horns turned down, bites on a head resembling a taotie. This remarkable work demonstrates that men wore zoomorphic masks in ritual ceremony.",

"country": "China",
"description": "For this type of vessel the term Lei is confirmed by inscriptions. The Lei represents a vessel class in which a typical pottery shape has been translated into bronze. The decor, on a ground of spirals squared except for a single row of rounded ones, occupies four areas. In the lower part of the body is a band of large hanging blades, their borders scored, like flanges, with straight and T-shaped scores. Each contains two antithetical figures in flat, band relief. These are actually extreme corruptions of beaked dragons with bodies coalescing at the point of the blade. For this origin, see Karlgren Number 26, Plate 39 (50.46.101). Birds with cleft crests and heart-shaped horns alternate with whorl circles in the neck and lid belts. On the shoulder belt between are strongly stylized dragons with the same head serving two differently shaped dragon bodies a winged dragon on the one side, a dragon with curled-up tail and an extra plume on the tail end on the other. The animals' heads on the top of the ring handles are the same as the one seen en face on the lower part of the body. Patina silver green.",
"comments": "Used for holding wine and sometimes water, this piece represents a category of vessels in which a typical pottery shape has been translated into bronze. New technology accommodated precise decorative schemes—thinner vessel walls and more structurally sound knobs, handles, and pendant rings—than was possible in pottery. As bronze artisans continued to perfect their craft, vessels became increasingly elaborate, intricately cast, and varied in form.",

The animal forming the terminal curve is a dragon with a bottle horn and a body that bends violently to the left before rising vertically with a leg and claw on the outer (left) side. Toward the end it cleaves, one strand curling out into an ordinary tail, the other going on and ending in a second dragon head at the base of the mid-handle lozenge field. This dragon head has a big crest falling down along the back. The crest takes the shape of a bird, with a big V-shaped horn and a small crest connecting with the forehead of the first dragon a striking and ingenious composition. The dragon body is adorned with rows of scales and with alternating straight and T-shaped scores in the manner of a flange.",
"comments": "A ladle like this would have been part of an elaborate set of ritual wine vessels of the Western Zhou. It would have been used to spoon wine into smaller vessels such as a jue. The handle is divided into three sections: a taotie (composite animal) mask just behind the bowl; a band of lozenges with a plain, narrow central ridge midway along the handle; and a rather elaborate arrangement of dragons at the end of the handle. The animal forming the final curve of the spoon is a dragon; its body bends violently to the left before rising vertically, its leg and claw on the outside of the handle.",

Although they retain the same decorative organization of the earliest examples, the bi disks from the Han dynasty tend to be more elaborate than their Neolithic predecessors. The outer band of this bi boasts openwork designs of pairs of dragons and phoenixes, whereas earlier examples display incised designs in solid stone. On the other hand, the raised bosses toward the center of this bi (known as guwen or “grain pattern”) are simpler in comparison to earlier Western Han examples, which were accompanied by incised spirals that suggested sprouting grain—perhaps a symbol of fertility. By the late Han dynasty, the curving tail became less obvious or disappeared completely, as seen here.",

"description": "The exuberent decor of this vessel is typical of the A style. In the neck belt, above two rigid rings, are two ordinary t'ao-t'ieh flanked by whorl circles. The t'ao-t'ieh on the throat has the usual features detatched from each other, but still conveying the idea of the image. An unusual detail is the S-shaped horns, here formed of snakes. The belly of the vessel is divided into four panels by flanges providing thecentral line of the owl's face, its beak protruding plastically from the flange. The horns are leaf-shaped, the eyes enormous, with pupils perhaps inlaid with precious stones. The owl's body, its wings adorned with scales, extends outward on each side from the flange, which continues to, and into, the foot belt. The thigh, a broad spiral, and the leg extending into the foot belt, are stiffly drawn. That the owl- at the same time one bird seen EN FACE and two birds seen in profile - here corresponds to the familiar t'ao-t'ieh, is emphasized by the fact that the usual flanking animals accompany it vertical dragons behind them. Under the owl's tail are head-turning dragons. In the lowest belt, snakes flank the owls' feet. The lid is semispherical with a band of spirals as the sole decor. A bird with bottle horns and spread wings is affixed to the lid by a flat rivet with a round head. Patina sharp green.",

"description": "The decor of incised lines and spirals on this animal recall those on the Middle Chou water buffalo, Karlgren Number 90 (50.46.113). It should be noted, however, that the spirals on shoulders and hind quarters area here centered by a raised ring with turquoise inlay. These decor figures might point to a similar epoch were it not for certain details that are a clear indication of a later date. The rope pattern around the eyes, on the eyebrows, the fetlocks, and on the dragon decorating the socket, as well as the granulation on the front of the ears and the head of the dragon, point to the Early Huai Style Period. The socket on the back suggests that the tiger served as a podium. Patina bluish- green.",
"comments": "This tiger with socket clearly served as the base for an upright support of some sort. Treatment of certain details like the rope patterns around the eyes, on the socket and eyebrows, and fetlocks and the granulation pattern on the ears indicate a date around 500 B.C.E.",

Yazhang scepters vary in their form and scale according to culture and geography. This yazhang has a long, narrow blade that curves slightly and ends in a nearly symmetrical, lunar-shaped cutting edge. On the other end, between the rectangular handle and blade, pairs of ornate teeth project beyond the edges of the scepter and are connected by incised horizontal bands. A central perforation has been drilled from one side at the stem of the handle. In its scale, shape, and toothed projections, this scepter resembles those from the late period of the Erlitou culture, which flourished in the central plains of China.",

The ring-shaped top of the lid, adorned with a triple-strand plait pattern in openwork, is affixed to the lid with a row of small props. The close affinity of this vessel to one almost exactly similar in the Royal Ontario Museum is interesting in view of the fact that the latter is known to have come from the Kin-ts'un tombs (Ca.450-230 B.C.).

The surfaces of the vessel are divided into four vertical panels by four flanges on the foot, two flanges and two handles on the body. These narrow, thin flanges contrast contrast sharply with the heavy handles and their massive bovine heads. The principal figures in the decor, executed in low relief except for the strongly protruding eyes, are so covered with adorning lines that they tend to merge with the ground of squared spirals. In the foot belt are rudimentary t'ao-t'ieh masks, the central line formrd by two of the flanges, and two consecutive, head-turning dragons with C-shaped horns. The mask t'ao-t'ieh on the belly, with ordinary features strongly detatched, is flanked by vertical dragons. The flanges form the centers of two such t'ao-tieh, the handles of two other masks in which the face (nose and hooked forehead shield) has been cleft, leavint an interstice as broad as the handles between the two halves. This space under the handles is decorated with a bovine head in flat relief, thus creating a small t'ao-t'ieh inside a larger one. The neck belt displays dragons with oversized beaks. Patina blackish.",
"comments": "This vessel is among the earliest gui with looped handles, which emerged in the latest period of the Shang dynasty. The surfaces of the vessel are divided into four vertical panels by four flanges on the foot and two flanges and two handles on the body. These narrow, thin flanges contrast sharply with the heavy handles and their massive bovine heads. The taotie mask on the belly is flanked by vertical dragons. The principal figures in the surface decor, executed in low relief except for the strongly protruding eyes, are so covered with embellished lines that they tend to merge with the ground of squared spirals. The vessel bears a single script inscription, “Shi,” which stands as an insignia for a clan. In recent years, a large number of bronzes unearthed in modern Shandong bear the same inscription, dating from the late Shang to early Western Zhou, thus revealing the location of this powerful clan whose members served in the court of the Shang king.

"comments": "The innately beautiful bluish-green color of this ritual scepter, with its russet inclusions combines with a simplicity and elegance of form to elevate this ancient object to a realm of aesthetic grace that is timeless. Ceremonial weapons and implements represent some of the earliest Chinese jades as the origins of this type of object lies in the Neolithic period. It was largely during the early Bronze Age however, in Shang and Western Zhou, that some utilitarian weapon types evolved into a limited group of particular shapes executed in precious jade that held ritual significance in important political and social ceremonies. Most of the ceremonial jade scepters that have survived were buried in tombs suggesting they also held significance for the spirit in the afterlife. Ancient bronze inscriptions record the use of land and jade as gifts between rulers and dependents. It is possible that the Chang scepters this type may have been part of the insignia used in rites connected with the land.",

"comments": "Used by literati to impress their personal marks on documents and works of art, seals were among the most important scholar's implements. The literati often carved the legends themselves. Bronze and jade were commonly used for seals before the Yüan dynasty (1280–1368), but these materials proved too hard to be carved by anyone but professionals. In the Ming dynasty, soapstone became the preferred material of the literati. Scholars readily carved the soft material in their personal calligraphic styles. Like literati paintings, seals expressed the taste and personality of their owners. The squared, angular characters and simple, forceful calligraphy in these examples were inspired by Han dynasty (2nd century BCE–2nd century CE) script, which along with bronze inscriptions and other early styles of calligraphy was studied and emulated by the wen ren. The tortoise at the top of each seal often appeared in Han dynasty seals. It symbolized longevity, strength, and endurance, traits associated with the scholar.",

The decor ground is of spirals of varying size throughout. The bird in the foot belt, of the regular type, displays one odd variation.

In this instance, however, the shorter part is modified so as to resemble the leg of the bird, giving the impression that the bird has one front and one hind leg. The tuft in the middle, whee the tail goes out from the boky, is a common feature (cf. vessel 50.46.19, Karlgren #33). The winged dragon in the upper belt has a small vertial crest and a big bottle horn with a fingerleaf top that has an eye in the center of the leaf. Patina grey-green in neck and foot belts.",

"description": "Xu Beihong (1895-1953) was an important early pioneer in the introduction of Western art to China and in the adaptation of it to Chinese character. As one of the most acclaimed painters and educators in modern China, he influenced the development of 20th-century Chinese painting. \r\n\r\nXu was born in a village in Yixing, Jiangsu province. He studied painting in his hometown and Shanghai before having an opportunity to go to Europe. In the period from 1919 to 1927, he studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, acquiring a solid foundation in the Western academic tradition. On returning to China, Xu became a powerful force for the introduction of Western art through his teaching, writing and exhibitions; his influence was rivalled only by Liu Haisu and Lin Fengmian. After 1949, with the founding of the People’s Republic, he settled in Beijing and became Director of the new Central Academy of Fine Arts and Chairman of the National Artists’ Association. \r\n\r\nHorse is Xu's favourite subject matter. This painting reflects the artist's principal artistic concern, namely, to bring together the Western academic tradition of painting and Chinese aesthetics through ink techniques. The work was made in summer 1944, shortly before the artist had a medical operation. It was given by him to Miss Ellen Wilkinson (1891-1947), a prominent member of the Labour cabinet in Clement Attlee's government. It was given to the V&A by her sister, Miss Ann Wilkinson, after her death.",
